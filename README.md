NGO Medicine Donation Platform
Overview
The NGO Medicine Donation Platform is a web-based initiative aimed at bridging the gap between surplus medicines and those in urgent need. This platform empowers individuals and pharmaceutical organizations to donate unused, safe, and valid medicines to NGOs, who then redistribute them to underprivileged communities.

The system is designed to promote healthcare accessibility, reduce medicinal waste, and support social welfare programs.
